### **Handling Multiple Windows with Selenium**:

When a web application opens multiple browser windows or tabs, Selenium provides mechanisms to switch between these windows and perform actions accordingly. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where clicking a button, link, or menu opens a new window, and you need to interact with elements in both windows.

### **Steps to Handle Multiple Windows**:

1. **Click a Button/Link/Element that Opens a New Window**:
   - Locate the element (e.g., button, link) that triggers the opening of a new window.
   - Click on the element to open the new window.

2. **Get Window Handles**:
   - Use `driver.getWindowHandles()` to retrieve all window handles. Each handle is a unique identifier for a window.
   - Store these handles in a set to iterate over them easily.

3. **Switch to the New Window**:
   - Loop through the window handles and compare them with the original window handle.
   - Once you find the new window handle, switch to it using `driver.switchTo().window(handle)`.
   - Perform actions on the new window (e.g., interact with elements, perform clicks, input text, etc.).

4. **Switch Back to the Original Window** (if needed):
   - After performing the required actions in the new window, switch back to the original window using the original window handle.
