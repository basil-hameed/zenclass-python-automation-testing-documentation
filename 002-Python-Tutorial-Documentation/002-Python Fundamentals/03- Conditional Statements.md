### Conditional Statements in Python ###

---

- Conditional statements allow a program to execute different code based on certain conditions.  
- Key constructs in Python include:

**`if-elif-else`:** Conditional branching based on a true or false condition. Python does not have a `switch-case` construct, but similar functionality can be achieved using `if-elif` chains or dictionaries.

**Example (`if-else`):**  
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```
