### Loop Statements and Lists in Python ###

---

**Loop Statements:**  
Loops allow executing a block of code repeatedly. Common types in Python are `for` and `while` loops.

**Example (`for` loop):**  
```python
for i in range(1, 6):  # Loop from 1 to 5
    print(f"Iteration {i}")
```

**Lists :**  
Lists are used to store multiple values, which can be of the same or different types. Unlike arrays in Java, Python lists are dynamic in size.

**Example (declaring and initializing a list):**  
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
```
