### Data Types, Variables in Python ###

---

**Data Types:**  
In Python, data types classify the type of data that a variable can hold. Python has built-in data types such as `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, and more. Unlike Java, Python dynamically assigns data types during runtime.

**Variables:**  
Variables are containers used to store data values. Python does not require explicit declaration of data types, as it is dynamically typed. A variable is created when a value is assigned to it.

**For example:**  
```python
# Declaration and initialization of an int variable
age = 25  
```
