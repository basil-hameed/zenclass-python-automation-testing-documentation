### Why Do We Need Pytest in Selenium?

Pytest is particularly useful in Selenium automation testing for the following reasons:

---

**Parallel Execution**:

Pytest allows for parallel execution of tests using plugins like `pytest-xdist`, which enables running tests concurrently on multiple browsers and platforms, thereby saving time.

**Grouping and Prioritizing**:

Tests can be grouped and prioritized using `pytest.mark` decorators, making it easier to organize tests logically and set execution priorities.

**Data Parameterization**:

Pytest supports data-driven testing through `pytest.mark.parametrize`, allowing tests to be run with different sets of data without code duplication.

**Dependency Management**:

Pytest provides mechanisms to handle test dependencies using fixtures, ensuring that tests are run in a specific order.

**Reporting**:

Pytest generates detailed HTML reports by default, which provide insights into test execution results, making it easier to analyze test failures and successes.
