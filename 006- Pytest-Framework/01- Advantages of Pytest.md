### **Advantages of Pytest over JUnit:**

**a. Parallel Test Execution**:

Pytest allows for parallel execution of test cases using plugins such as `pytest-xdist`, making test execution faster and more efficient.

**b. Flexible Test Configuration**:

Pytest offers flexible test configuration through command-line options, allowing users to define various parameters for test suites without needing an XML file. This includes test markers, plugins, and custom fixtures.

**c. Test Prioritization**:

With Pytest, you can mark tests with `@pytest.mark.priority(level)` to set test priorities, ensuring critical tests run before others.

**d. Grouping of Test Methods**:

Tests can be grouped using `pytest.mark` decorators, allowing for better organization and selection of tests to run.

**e. Data Parameterization**:

Pytest allows parameterization of tests using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator, making it easy to run the same test with different sets of data without duplicating code.

**f. Built-in Reporting**:

Pytest provides built-in reporting with the option to generate detailed HTML reports through plugins like `pytest-html`. This default reporting offers clear insights into test execution results and failures.
